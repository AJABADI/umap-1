\description{
A list with parameters customizing a UMAP projection. Each component of the
list is an effective argument for umap().
}
\details{
n.neighbors: integer; number of nearest neighbors

n.components: integer; dimension of target (output) space

metric.function: character or functions; determines how distances between
data points are computed.

n.epochs: integer; number of iterations performed during
layout optimization

input: character, use either "data" or "dist"; determines whether the primary
input argument to umap() is treated as a data matrix or as a distance matrix

init: character or matrix. The default string "random" instructs the algorithm
to create an initial layout based on random coordinates. This setting.can also
be set to a matrix, in which case layout optimization begins from the provided
coordinates.

min.dist: numeric; determines how close points appear in the final layout

set.op.mix.ratio: numeric in range [0,1]; determines who the knn-graph
is used to create a fuzzy simplicial graph

local.connectivity: numeric; used during construction of fuzzy simplicail set

bandwidth: numeric; used during construction of fuzzy simplicial set

alpha: numeric; initial value of "learning rate" of layout optimization

beta: numeric; determines, together with alpha, the learning rate of layout optimization

negative.sample.rate: integer; determines how many non-neighbor points are
used per point and per iteration during layout optimization

a: numeric; contributes to gradient calculations during layout optimization.
When left at NA, a suitable value will be estimated automatically.

b: numeric; contributes to gradient calculationss during layout optimization.

spread: numeric; used during automatic estimation of a/b parameters.

seed: integer; seed for random number generation

verbose: logical or integer; determines whether to show progress messages
