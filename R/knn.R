## functions to compute k nearest neighbors


##' get information about k nearest neighbors from a distance object or from a matrix
##' with distances
##'
##' This implementation uses sorting of distances to identify the k elements 
##' that are nearest to each data point. The result is deterministic and exact.
##'
##' By definition, the first nearest neighbor to each point is the point itself.
##' Subsequent neighbors are "true" neighbors.
##'
##' @param d dist object or matrix with distances
##' @param k integer, number of neighbors
##'
##' @return list with two components;
##' indexes identifies, for each point in dataset, the set of k neighbors
##' distances provides distances from each point to those neighbors
